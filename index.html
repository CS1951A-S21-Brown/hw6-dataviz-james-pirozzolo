        <div class="map-title">Written Questions</div>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented:<br>
                The top graph is a bar chart that clearly displays the top ten video games by global sales in the selected year. 
                The second graph is a map that, when hovered over, tells the user the top genre in the region being hovered over.
                The last graph is a pie chart that displays the top publishers for the specified genre. From this, the user can 
                easily find the top publisher based on the largest piece of the pie (I understand that pie charts are often 
                criticized as it can be difficult to compare pie slices but in this case I believe that it effectively answers
                the question).</li>
            <li>List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>It made it possible to dynamically update the charts based on user input</li>
                    <li>It gave me more ability to customize my graphs than any software/tool I have ever used</li>
                    <li>I was able to use d3 resources to make a map in which each country correlated to particular data</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>If I just needed to make something quickly I wouldn't use d3</li>
                    <li>For a static dataset, d3 might be overkill</li>
                    <li>It might not be the best if interaction with the visualization wasn't relevant</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>In general, I think that my dashboard does a good job of addresssing some of the concepts discussed in the readings.
                The color scheme was selected to be accessible to color blind individuals and my visualizations are self-explanatory 
                and, in my opinion, are effective at conveying their respective data. With that being said, my page would not be
                accessible to a screen reader. I did not put in text descriptions or alt text in order to allow a screen reader to 
                effectively convey my page to a blind person or other individuals who require the use of sound instead of sight. 
                Additionally, as all of my graphs rely on popups that occur when sections are hovered over, my visualization is not 
                well suited to those who may not understand what the popup tells the user (although I believe they are pretty self-
                explanatory). One other aspect in which my dataviz is accessible is because I give the user access to the raw data 
                through a link in the header.
            </li>
            <li>
                I think I did a solid job at designing my dashboard with accessibility in mind. There are two things that I would've 
                changed. When planning my dashboard, I thought that popups would be the most effective way to convey specific data 
                about sections on my visualizations. In hindsight, I think that the popups are effective to those who understand what 
                they are trying to show. At the same time, I find them somewhat distracting (especially with the map as I had to specify 
                by country, not continent so europe, for example, is represented as all of its countries.) Even though I had thought 
                this would be an effective way to make my dashboard clean yet informative, I definitely should have thought of a more 
                effective method, but all in all I am content with them as a straightforward way to demonstrate the data. Lastly, 
                this seems like a good place to mention this, but I could not for the life of me change the color of the axis labels 
                on the top chart to the color scheme of the rest. This is not necessarily an accessibility issue, but I felt the need 
                to mention it here as it is an aspect of my dashboard that if I was doing again I would change.
            </li>
            <li>
                For a dynamic stats calculation I calculated the thresholds for each game to be in each percentile for sales. This is 
                mentioned in the handout as an example of a stats calculation. In order to calculate it I count the number of games in 
                a particular year, sort them, and index into it to retrieve the sales of the percentile threshold (0.01 * num games = 
                index of 99th percentile threshold).
